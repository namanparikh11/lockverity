# Lockverity Windows portable package

The Lockverity Windows portable package is a
self-contained, single-folder, no-installer distribution
of the Lockverity local runtime for Windows x64. It
bundles the FastAPI backend, the cross-platform
``lockverity-cli`` command, the React frontend, the
Alembic migrations, the approved brand assets, and the
``LICENSE`` into a single ZIP that an operator can
extract to any user-controlled directory and run without
administrator rights and without a separately installed
Python or Node.js runtime.

This document is the operator reference for the Windows
portable and the maintainer reference for the build
pipeline. The portable is the v2.1.2 Windows x64
portable; for the v2.1.2 Windows installer see
[`docs/windows-installer.md`](windows-installer.md). For
the central download and install guide see
[`docs/install.md`](install.md).

## TL;DR

1. Download ``Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip``.
2. Extract it to any directory the user controls
   (for example ``C:\Tools\Lockverity`` or
   ``C:\Users\<you>\Lockverity``).
3. Double-click ``Lockverity.exe`` to start the
   runtime and open the trusted local URL in the
   default browser.
4. From a second terminal, use ``lockverity-cli.exe``
   for the documented ``start``, ``stop``, ``status``,
   ``open``, ``doctor`` and ``logs`` subcommands.

No administrator rights are required at any point.
No system service, scheduled task, registry autorun, or
firewall rule is installed by the portable package.

## Directory layout

The portable root contains the user-facing entry points
plus a single ``_internal`` support directory that
PyInstaller generates. The exact internal layout of
``_internal`` is opaque; the user-facing root is
stable.

```
Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable\
  Lockverity.exe                  (windowless graphical launcher)
  lockverity-cli.exe               (console CLI; same commands as source-based lockverity)
  _internal\                       (PyInstaller support files; do not edit)
  frontend\dist\                   (bundled React build; read-only)
    index.html
    assets\
    favicon.ico, favicon-*.png
    brand\
      lockverity-symbol.png
      lockverity-horizontal-logo.png
  alembic\                         (frozen Alembic scripts; read-only)
    versions\
  alembic.ini                      (frozen config; read-only)
  favicon.ico                      (approved Part A icon)
  brand\                           (approved Part A PNGs)
  LICENSE                          (MIT)
  README-PORTABLE.txt              (this file, bundled at the frozen root)
  THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt          (Python + frontend dependency licences)
  BUILD-MANIFEST.json              (build provenance)
  SHA256SUMS.txt                   (SHA-256 of every user-facing file)
```

The frozen directory is treated as read-only application
content. The portable never writes databases, logs,
state files, or user data beside the executable.
Deleting the extracted folder does not affect any
runtime state.

## Default runtime home

The runtime stores databases, logs, the state file,
the start lock, and any operator overrides in the
**runtime home** under the user's local AppData:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\
  data\        (SQLite databases)
  logs\        (rotating lockverity.log)
  run\         (state file and start lock)
  config\      (operator overrides, if any)
```

The runtime home is created on first start. An
operator can override the path with the
``LOCKVERITY_HOME`` environment variable; the
override is honoured by both the graphical launcher
and the CLI.

## Graphical launcher (``Lockverity.exe``)

The launcher is a windowless Windows application that
uses the approved Part A ``favicon.ico`` as its
executable icon. It does not open a persistent console
window; the operator does not see a terminal flash.

On invocation, the launcher:

1. Resolves the runtime home (default
   ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity``).
2. Calls the documented Part B2 ``status`` logic to
   determine whether a healthy instance is already
   running.
3. If a healthy instance exists, opens the trusted
   local URL in the default browser and exits.
4. If no instance is running, starts a new background
   instance via the documented Part B2 ``start``
   logic, waits for the health endpoint, then opens
   the browser.
5. On a stale or unhealthy instance, runs bounded
   recovery and refuses to terminate unrelated
   processes. If automatic safe recovery is
   impossible, shows a native message box with the
   log path and a recommendation to run
   ``lockverity-cli.exe doctor``.

A second double-click reuses the same running instance
without starting a second server. The launcher never
requires administrator rights.

The launcher exit codes are documented in
``backend/app/launcher/__init__.py`` so a future
installer can match them:

| Code | Meaning                                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Success (browser opened or already-open instance reused). |
| 20   | Generic launcher error.                                   |
| 21   | Port already in use by an unrelated process.              |
| 22   | Database migration failure.                               |
| 23   | Health endpoint did not report ready in time.             |
| 24   | Bundled frontend dist is missing or invalid.              |

## Console CLI (``lockverity-cli.exe``)

The console CLI exposes the documented v2.1 Part B2
subcommands. The contract is identical to the
source-based ``lockverity`` command; an operator who
switches between the two should not see a difference
beyond the file extension.

The CLI exit codes are:

| Code | Meaning                                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Success.                                                     |
| 1    | Generic error.                                               |
| 2    | Health or allow-remote guard violation.                      |
| 64   | Command-line usage error.                                    |
| 130  | SIGINT / ``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` (foreground mode interrupted). |

``docs/release-checklist.md``.

## First-launch behaviour

The first time a portable extraction is launched:

1. The runtime home is created under
   ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity``.
2. The bundled Alembic migrations run against a fresh
   SQLite database. Existing databases are preserved
   verbatim; only missing migrations are applied.
3. The server starts on ``127.0.0.1:8000`` unless
   overridden.
4. The browser opens the trusted local URL.

The first-launch migration can take a few seconds on
older hardware. The launcher shows the log path in a
native message box if the migration or the health
probe does not complete in time.

## Troubleshooting

If the launcher shows a native message box, the box
contains the runtime log path. Run the diagnostic:

```
lockverity-cli.exe doctor --json
```

The ``doctor`` command inspects the runtime
environment (Python interpreter is frozen so the
check is informational only; SQLite, Alembic, the
frontend dist, the start lock, the port, the brand
assets, the licence, and the live process identity)
and prints a structured JSON report.

For background output, inspect the rotating log at
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\logs\lockverity.log`` or
use the documented ``lockverity-cli.exe logs``
subcommand.

If the port is in use by an unrelated process, the
launcher refuses to terminate the process and shows a
message box that names the conflicting port. The
operator can either stop the conflicting process or
launch with a different port.

## Unsigned-build / SmartScreen warning

The portable package is not code-signed. Windows may
display **Unknown publisher** and/or a Microsoft Defender
SmartScreen warning when an unsigned build is launched.
Verify the package integrity using the ``SHA256SUMS.txt``
file and the documented ``BUILD-MANIFEST.json`` before
deciding whether to proceed.

See the [Code signing policy](code-signing-policy.md) and
[Privacy policy](privacy.md).

## Antivirus heuristic detections

Unsigned or newly distributed binaries may trigger heuristic
antivirus detections. The portable package uses
the standard PyInstaller onedir layout without UPX or
any other compression. Verify the published SHA-256 and
provenance; suspected false positives can be submitted to
the relevant vendor for review with the ``SHA256SUMS.txt``
and ``BUILD-MANIFEST.json``. The source commit SHA is
verifiable on the public GitHub repository.

## Not a Windows installer

The portable is a "drop anywhere" artefact. The v2.1.2
release also ships a per-user Windows installer for
operators who prefer a Start Menu entry and a registered
uninstall path; see
[`docs/windows-installer.md`](windows-installer.md) for
the installer reference. Installing the portable into
``Program Files`` is supported but not recommended
because the runtime home continues to live under
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity`` and the user
preference is to keep the portable directory
self-contained.

## No service, no auto-update, no telemetry

The portable package does not install a Windows
service, a scheduled task, a registry autorun, or a
firewall rule. It does not include an automatic
update mechanism. It does not collect, transmit, or
phone home any telemetry. The web application binds to
``127.0.0.1``. GitHub repository intake necessarily
contacts GitHub to resolve and download the submitted
repository. At scan execution, OSV, deps.dev, and OpenSSF
Scorecard are enabled by default when applicable and can
be selected independently; disabled providers receive no
client, cache, or network call. See the
[privacy policy](privacy.md). The portable package also
includes this policy as ``PRIVACY.md``.

## Clean uninstall

To uninstall the portable:

1. Stop the running instance with
   ``lockverity-cli.exe stop`` (or close the launcher
   if no instance is running).
2. Delete the extracted folder.
3. Optionally delete the runtime home at
   ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity`` to remove all
   databases, logs, and state.

Step 3 is independent of step 2: deleting the
extracted folder does not affect the runtime home, and
deleting the runtime home does not affect the extracted
folder. The two are intentionally separate so an
operator can wipe state without losing the application
or vice versa.

## Build instructions for maintainers

The portable package is built by the committed
``backend/scripts/build_windows_portable.py``
script. The script is the single source of truth for
how the artefact is produced.

Prerequisites on the build host:

* Windows x64
* Python 3.12.x in the project venv
* Node.js 22.22.0 or newer on PATH
* The ``build`` optional-dependency group installed:
  ``pip install -e '.[build]'``
* The approved Part A brand assets under
  ``frontend/public/favicon.ico`` and
  ``frontend/public/brand\`` (committed; do not
  regenerate)

Build command:

```
python backend\scripts\build_windows_portable.py
```

Useful options:

* ``--clean`` removes the dedicated packaging work
  directory before starting.
* ``--skip-frontend-build`` skips the
  ``prepare_frontend_dist.py`` step (assumes a fresh
  ``frontend/dist`` is already in place).
* ``--skip-smoke`` skips the packaged smoke checks
  (faster; do not use for a release).
* ``--output-dir <path>`` writes the artefact under
  ``<path>\windows\`` instead of the default
  ``dist\windows\``.
* ``--keep-work`` retains the dedicated packaging
  work directory for inspection.
* ``--json-report <path>`` writes a structured JSON
  report of the build to ``<path>``.

The build script writes the SHA-256 of every
user-facing file to ``SHA256SUMS.txt`` and a structured
``BUILD-MANIFEST.json`` containing the source commit
SHA, the build timestamp in UTC, the Python and
PyInstaller versions, the Node and npm versions, the
Alembic head, and the SHA-256 of every approved brand
asset.

The committed ``backend/pyinstaller/lockverity.spec``
and ``backend/pyinstaller/cli.spec`` files are the
canonical PyInstaller inputs. Do not commit
auto-generated mutable spec output; the committed
specs are reviewed and pinned.

## What the portable does not include

The following items are explicit future work and are
**not** included in the v2.1.2 portable:

* Code signing and SmartScreen reputation building.
* Automatic update mechanism.
* Linux or macOS packaging.
* Docker packaging.
* A system service, scheduled task, or
  ``launchd``/``systemd`` integration.
* Backup / restore tooling.
* Cloud sync, multi-user, or authentication.
* Telemetry, crash reporting, or outbound analytics.

The v2.1.2 Windows installer is a separate distribution
that uses Inno Setup; see
[`docs/windows-installer.md`](windows-installer.md). Code
signing, automatic updates, and additional packaging
targets are separate deliverables that may be addressed
on later release tracks.

## Verifying the artefact

The SHA-256 hashes of every user-facing file are in
``SHA256SUMS.txt``. The source commit, the build
timestamp, the Python and PyInstaller versions, the
Node and npm versions, the Alembic head, and the
approved brand-asset hashes are in
``BUILD-MANIFEST.json``. The dependency inventory
(including declared licences) is in
``THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt``. The documented public build
command builds the artefact from the recorded source and inputs;
deterministic, bit-for-bit reproducibility is not claimed.
