# Lockverity v2.1.2 — Install guide

This is the central install guide for **Lockverity v2.1.2**. It
covers every supported install path: the Windows installer, the
Windows portable, the macOS source-based setup, and the Linux
source-based setup.

The published release assets are hosted on the GitHub Release
[`checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/tag/checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release).
The release page is the canonical download index. The
`/releases/latest` URL always points to the current latest
release.

## What changed in v2.1.2

v2.1.2 is a narrow Windows-only hotfix on top of v2.1.1.
All documented install paths and runtime contracts are
unchanged. The two Windows-specific fixes are:

1. **Settings → Installed apps shows the Lockverity
   icon.** The v2.1.0 / v2.1.1 installer declared
   ``UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\Lockverity.exe`` --
   a path that does not exist on disk (the launcher
   is installed under ``{app}\app``) and that
   omitted the explicit ``,0`` icon index. v2.1.2
   fixes the path to
   ``{app}\app\Lockverity.exe,0`` and rebuilds the
   canonical Windows ICO with the full size set
   the Windows shell queries
   (16/24/32/48/64/128/256).
2. **Authenticode signing-readiness hooks.** A
   disabled-by-default helper
   (``backend/scripts/_authenticode_sign.py``)
   exposes the documented env-var contract for a
   future trusted Authenticode provider. The
   release is **not signed**; ``Unknown publisher``
   and SmartScreen warnings may still appear.
   Verify the SHA-256 hash before installing.

## Choosing a distribution

| Pick this | If you are a… |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows installer** (`.exe`) | Normal Windows user who wants the simplest install |
| **Windows portable** (`.zip`) | Operator who cannot install (locked-down laptop, USB-only workflow) |
| **Source code** (the `Code → Download ZIP` button on the GitHub repository) | Developer or auditor who wants to read or modify the code |
| macOS source setup | Developer or technical operator on macOS |
| Linux source setup | Developer or technical operator on Linux |

The v2.1.0 release does **not** publish a DMG, PKG, AppImage, DEB,
or RPM asset. macOS and Linux are source-based developer
workflows; they are not at the same packaged-acceptance level as
the Windows installer or portable.

## Windows installer

The Windows installer is the recommended option for most Windows
users. It is per-user (no admin, no UAC), per-architecture (x64
only), and self-contained.

### Download and verify

1. Download
   [`Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-setup.exe`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/download/checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release/Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-setup.exe).
2. Verify the SHA-256:

   ```powershell
   Get-FileHash .\Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
   ```

   The output hash must equal
   `5e47d2bcf0d4e5c2f9654434328c6adecca800161505e775bae01bef121bc8bb`.
   The same value is in
   [`Lockverity-2.1.2-SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/download/checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release/Lockverity-2.1.2-SHA256SUMS.txt)
   and in the bundled `INSTALLER-MANIFEST.json` next to the
   installer EXE.
3. Double-click the installer.
4. Read the licence, accept it, and click **Install**. No UAC
   prompt appears because the installer is per-user.
5. Optionally check **Launch Lockverity** on the completion page
   to open the trusted loopback URL in your default browser.

After install, the Start Menu contains a **Lockverity** folder
with the application shortcut, the documentation link, and the
**Uninstall Lockverity** entry. Apps & Features shows the
per-user **Lockverity** entry under the current user.

### Silent install

```powershell
Lockverity-2.1.0-windows-x64-setup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /SP- ^
    /DIR="C:\Apps\Lockverity" ^
    /LOG="C:\Temp\lockverity-install.log"
```

| Switch | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `/VERYSILENT` | No wizard pages or progress UI. |
| `/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES` | Suppresses any blocking message box. |
| `/NORESTART` | Do not request a Windows reboot. |
| `/SP-` | Skip the **Welcome** page. |
| `/DIR=<path>` | Override the install path. Supports spaces and Unicode. |
| `/LOG=<file>` | Write the install log to the given file. |

### SmartScreen and antivirus

The installer is **not code-signed**. On a fresh install,
**Windows SmartScreen** will show
*"Windows protected your PC — Microsoft Defender SmartScreen
prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app
might put your PC at risk."* Click **More info → Run anyway** to
proceed. SmartScreen remembers the choice for the same
executable.

Some antivirus products will raise a heuristic flag on a freshly
downloaded unsigned binary. This is a false positive: the source
is committed in this repository and the build is reproducible
from `python backend\scripts\build_windows_installer.py`. Submit
the flagged file to your AV vendor as a false positive if it
blocks the install.

### Where things live after install

| What | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Application files | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Lockverity\app\` |
| Database | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\data\` |
| Logs | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\logs\` |
| Runtime state | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\run\` |
| Operator overrides | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\config\` |

The runtime home is preserved by uninstall; see below.

### Launch and CLI

After install, click the Start Menu shortcut, or invoke the
installed binary directly:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Lockverity\app\Lockverity.exe"
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Lockverity\app\lockverity-cli.exe" --version
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Lockverity\app\lockverity-cli.exe" doctor
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Lockverity\app\lockverity-cli.exe" status
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Lockverity\app\lockverity-cli.exe" stop
```

The launcher starts the runtime in the background, waits for
`/api/v1/health`, then opens the trusted loopback URL in your
default browser. A second invocation of the launcher reuses the
existing instance (same PID, same port, same instance id).

### Reinstall / repair

Running the installer again performs a safe reinstall of the
accepted payload. The installer:

- detects a live installed instance via the documented Part B2
  identity check (state file + PID + creation time + instance
  UUID);
- requests a graceful stop via the installed
  `lockverity-cli.exe stop`;
- replaces the application files in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Lockverity\app\`;
- preserves your runtime data, databases, and logs in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\`;
- does not duplicate Start Menu or desktop shortcuts;
- does not rewrite the uninstaller registration.

The reinstall never terminates a process based on a PID alone,
and it never kills unrelated processes. If a safe shutdown
cannot be verified, the installer aborts with an actionable
message pointing at `lockverity-cli.exe doctor` and the runtime
log path.

### Uninstall

Start the uninstaller from
**Start Menu → Lockverity → Uninstall** or from
**Settings → Apps → Lockverity → Uninstall**. The uninstaller:

- detects a live installed instance and requests a graceful stop;
- removes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Lockverity\app\`;
- removes the Start Menu folder and the optional desktop
  shortcut;
- removes the per-user uninstaller registration;
- **preserves** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\` (databases, logs,
  configuration);
- shows a final dialog pointing at the retained-data path.

To remove runtime data manually after uninstalling:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Lockverity"
```

The full per-user, no-admin, no-service installer contract is
documented in
[`docs/windows-installer.md`](windows-installer.md).

## Windows portable

The Windows portable is a self-contained ZIP that bundles the
FastAPI backend, the cross-platform `lockverity-cli` command, the
React frontend, the Alembic migrations, and the approved Part A
brand assets. No separately installed Python or Node.js is
required; no administrator rights; no Windows service, scheduled
task, or registry autorun.

### Download and verify

1. Download
   [`Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/download/checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release/Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip).
2. Verify the SHA-256:

   ```powershell
   Get-FileHash .\Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip -Algorithm SHA256
   ```

   The output hash must equal
   `2713416222a962c14e05a78977c1433fb2a1a2776d428d8034b10a32351ec158`.
   The same value is in
   [`Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable-SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/download/checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release/Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable-SHA256SUMS.txt)
   and in the bundled `SHA256SUMS.txt` inside the ZIP.
3. **Extract the entire archive** to any directory the operator
   controls (for example `C:\Tools\Lockverity` or
   `C:\Users\<you>\Lockverity`). Do not run from inside the ZIP
   viewer; extract first.
4. Double-click `Lockverity.exe` to start the runtime and open
   the trusted local URL in the default browser.
5. From a second terminal, use `lockverity-cli.exe` for the
   documented `start`, `stop`, `status`, `open`, `doctor`, and
   `logs` subcommands. `lockverity-cli.exe doctor --json` prints
   a structured diagnostic report.

### Runtime home

The portable does **not** mean runtime data is stored beside the
EXE. The runtime home still defaults to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity` and is created on first launch. To
override the path, set the `LOCKVERITY_HOME` environment
variable.

### Removal

1. Stop the running instance with
   `lockverity-cli.exe stop` (or close the launcher if no
   instance is running).
2. Delete the extracted folder.
3. Optionally delete the runtime home at
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity` to remove all databases, logs,
   and state.

Step 3 is independent of step 2: deleting the extracted folder
does not affect the runtime home, and deleting the runtime home
does not affect the extracted folder.

The full portable operator reference is in
[`docs/windows-portable.md`](windows-portable.md).

## macOS source setup

Lockverity v2.1.0 does **not** publish a packaged macOS binary
(no `.dmg`, no `.pkg`, no signed `.app`). The macOS workflow is
**source-based only** and is intended for developers or technical
operators.

### Prerequisites

- **macOS 12 (Monterey)** or newer.
- **Python 3.12** (`brew install python@3.12` or your preferred
  manager). The lockfile pins 3.12.x.
- **Node.js >= 22.22.0** (use `nvm use`, `fnm use`, or
  `volta pin`). The repo ships an `.nvmrc` pinning the floor.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`).

### Source-based installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity.git
cd lockverity

# Backend: create the venv and install
cd backend
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Frontend: install and build the production bundle
cd ../frontend
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..

# Bring the database schema up to head
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
cd ..
```

### Start, status, doctor, logs, stop

Lockverity ships a cross-platform `lockverity` CLI. The CLI wraps
the single-port production runtime.

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

export LOCKVERITY_ENVIRONMENT=production
export LOCKVERITY_SERVE_FRONTEND=true
export LOCKVERITY_FRONTEND_DIST="../frontend/dist"
export LOCKVERITY_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///$HOME/Library/Application Support/Lockverity/data/lockverity.sqlite"

lockverity doctor
lockverity start
lockverity status --json
lockverity open
# ...work...
lockverity stop
```

The runtime home on macOS defaults to
`~/Library/Application Support/Lockverity` and is created on
first start. The state file, the database, the rotating log,
and the start lock all live under that path. Override the path
with `--home <path>` or `LOCKVERITY_HOME=<path>` for one
invocation or one shell respectively.

The full single-port runtime contract is in
[`docs/release-checklist.md` § 4a](release-checklist.md). The CLI
contract is in [`docs/release-checklist.md` § 4b](release-checklist.md).

## Linux source setup

Lockverity v2.1.0 does **not** publish a packaged Linux binary
(no `AppImage`, no `.deb`, no `.rpm`, no Flatpak, no Snap). The
Linux workflow is **source-based only** and is intended for
developers or technical operators.

### Prerequisites

- **Linux x86_64** (the build host for the Windows portable is
  Windows; the application itself is cross-platform Python).
  glibc 2.31+ (RHEL 8 / Ubuntu 20.04 equivalent or newer).
- **Python 3.12** (your distribution's package manager, or
  `pyenv install 3.12`).
- **Node.js >= 22.22.0** (use `nvm use`, `fnm use`, or
  `volta pin`). The repo ships an `.nvmrc` pinning the floor.
- **Build tools** for the Python wheels you may need
  (`build-essential`, `libffi-dev`, `libssl-dev`).

### Source-based installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity.git
cd lockverity

# Backend: create the venv and install
cd backend
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Frontend: install and build the production bundle
cd ../frontend
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..

# Bring the database schema up to head
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
cd ..
```

### Start, status, doctor, logs, stop

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

export LOCKVERITY_ENVIRONMENT=production
export LOCKVERITY_SERVE_FRONTEND=true
export LOCKVERITY_FRONTEND_DIST="../frontend/dist"
export LOCKVERITY_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/lockverity/data/lockverity.sqlite"

lockverity doctor
lockverity start
lockverity status --json
lockverity open
# ...work...
lockverity stop
```

The runtime home on Linux defaults to
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/lockverity` and is created
on first start. The state file, the database, the rotating log,
and the start lock all live under that path. Override the path
with `--home <path>` or `LOCKVERITY_HOME=<path>` for one
invocation or one shell respectively.

The full single-port runtime contract is in
[`docs/release-checklist.md` § 4a](release-checklist.md). The CLI
contract is in [`docs/release-checklist.md` § 4b](release-checklist.md).

## Checksum verification

Every release asset has a SHA-256 in the external
[`Lockverity-2.1.2-SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/download/checkpoint-v2.1.2-public-release/Lockverity-2.1.2-SHA256SUMS.txt):

```
5e47d2bcf0d4e5c2f9654434328c6adecca800161505e775bae01bef121bc8bb  Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-setup.exe
2713416222a962c14e05a78977c1433fb2a1a2776d428d8034b10a32351ec158  Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip
0584c02bcba6bc89f78f39b988bdc47b48370a727719e628ad8ea05e1421cef4  INSTALLER-MANIFEST.json
3930297439251db303ac8de427087dc80973972925184a7bbd7c8de69d5b2679  BUILD-MANIFEST.json
```

The internal `Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable-SHA256SUMS.txt`
is a separate asset that lists the SHA-256 of every file inside
the portable ZIP (the launcher EXE, the CLI EXE, the build
manifest, the licence, the portable README, and the third-party
notices file).

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
Get-FileHash .\Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
shasum -a 256 Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-setup.exe
shasum -a 256 Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip
```

If the hash does not match, do not run the asset. Re-download
from the same URL; if the hash still differs, do not run the
asset and report the discrepancy to the maintainers.

## Previous v2.1.0 release (historical)

The v2.1.0 and v2.1.1 release assets are preserved on the
`checkpoint-v2.1.0-public-release` tag and remain
downloadable from the original release URL. v2.1.1 is a
code-only hotfix on top of v2.1.0; the v2.1.0 binaries
are not republished.

| Asset | SHA-256 | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Lockverity-2.1.0-windows-x64-setup.exe` | `db90854369d2bc0ca09fc935abe3f5213260f12229b979ab3bb55dfb5d73bec6` | 31,128,774 bytes |
| `Lockverity-2.1.0-windows-x64-portable.zip` | `a4414372c964f0f50d6e6a864d5a8b8c288acd8a5008e8d45a0ed67e8e58f302` | 56,088,933 bytes |

## Unsigned-build warning

The Lockverity v2.1.0 release is **not code-signed**:

- The Windows installer and the Windows portable are unsigned
  binaries. Windows SmartScreen will show *"Windows protected
  your PC"* on first launch. Click **More info → Run anyway**
  to proceed.
- Some antivirus products will raise a heuristic flag on a
  freshly downloaded unsigned binary. This is a false positive:
  the source is committed in this repository and the build is
  reproducible from the documented build commands.

The build scripts never claim Microsoft certification, code
signing, or SmartScreen reputation. The
[`INSTALLER-MANIFEST.json`](https://github.com/namanparikh11/lockverity/releases/download/checkpoint-v2.1.0-public-release/INSTALLER-MANIFEST.json)
records the unsigned status honestly.

## First launch

After the first start, the runtime:

1. Creates the runtime home
   (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity` on Windows,
   `~/Library/Application Support/Lockverity` on macOS,
   `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/lockverity` on Linux).
2. Runs Alembic migrations against a fresh SQLite database.
   Existing databases are preserved verbatim; only missing
   migrations are applied.
3. Starts the server on `127.0.0.1:8000` unless overridden.
4. Opens the trusted local URL in the default browser.

The first-launch migration can take a few seconds on older
hardware. The launcher shows the log path in a native message
box if the migration or the health probe does not complete in
time.

## CLI basics

The CLI is the supported way to start, stop, and inspect the
local instance on every platform. The full command reference is
in [`docs/release-checklist.md` § 4b](release-checklist.md).

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lockverity start` | Run Alembic migrations, launch the runtime (detached by default; foreground with `--foreground`), wait for `/api/v1/health`, write the state file. |
| `lockverity stop` | Verify the recorded identity, send `SIGTERM` (POSIX) or `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` (Windows), wait for the process to exit, clear the state file and release the start lock. |
| `lockverity status` | Show the current instance state in human-readable text or in the documented `--json` schema. |
| `lockverity open` | Open the local URL in the default browser via the platform `webbrowser` facility. |
| `lockverity doctor` | Run a read-only diagnostic checklist and report each check as PASS / WARN / FAIL. |
| `lockverity logs` | Show the rotating runtime log (bounded tail, optional `--follow`). |

The `status` subcommand follows a separate, documented contract:
`0` for running-and-healthy, `1` for stopped, and `2` for
unhealthy, stale, or misconfigured.

## Runtime-data locations

| Platform | Runtime home |
| --- | --- |
| Windows (installer) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity` |
| Windows (portable) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity` (NOT beside the EXE) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Lockverity` |
| Linux | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/lockverity` |

The runtime home contains four sub-directories (`data/`,
`logs/`, `run/`, `config/`) and is created on first start.
Override the path with `--home <path>` (one invocation) or
`LOCKVERITY_HOME=<path>` (one shell).

## Uninstall / removal

**Windows installer:**

- Start the uninstaller from
  **Start Menu → Lockverity → Uninstall** or from
  **Settings → Apps → Lockverity → Uninstall**.
- The uninstaller preserves `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\`.
- To wipe runtime data manually:
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Lockverity"`.

**Windows portable:**

- Stop the running instance with `lockverity-cli.exe stop`.
- Delete the extracted folder.
- Optionally delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity` to wipe runtime
  data.

**macOS / Linux:**

- Stop the running instance with `lockverity stop`.
- Delete the cloned source directory (or just remove
  `.venv`, `frontend/node_modules`, and `frontend/dist` if you
  want to keep the source for later).
- Optionally delete the runtime home
  (`~/Library/Application Support/Lockverity` on macOS or
  `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/lockverity` on Linux) to
  wipe the database, logs, and state.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First check |
| --- | --- |
| Installer does not start | Verify the SHA-256 of the installer EXE; run with `/LOG=<file>` and inspect the log. |
| Browser does not open after install | The installer never launches a browser. Invoke `Lockverity.exe` directly to see any error output. |
| Runtime is not reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` | Run `lockverity-cli.exe doctor` (or `lockverity doctor` on macOS / Linux). Read `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockverity\logs\lockverity.log` (or the equivalent runtime log path). |
| Reinstall fails with "still running" | Run `lockverity-cli.exe status`; if the recorded PID is dead but the state file remains, run `lockverity-cli.exe stop` and retry. |
| SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" | This is the expected behaviour for an unsigned binary. Click **More info → Run anyway**. SmartScreen remembers the choice for the same executable. |
| Antivirus flags the binary | Submit the flagged file to your AV vendor as a false positive. Reference the `SHA256SUMS.txt` and the `BUILD-MANIFEST.json` from the same release. |
| Port `8000` is in use by an unrelated process | The runtime refuses to terminate the unrelated process. Stop the conflicting process or launch with `--port <N>`. |

The full installer-specific troubleshooting guide is in
[`docs/windows-installer.md`](windows-installer.md). The full
portable-specific troubleshooting guide is in
[`docs/windows-portable.md`](windows-portable.md).

## Distinction between release assets and source archives

| What you downloaded | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `Lockverity-2.1.0-windows-x64-setup.exe` | The Windows installer. Run it to install. |
| `Lockverity-2.1.0-windows-x64-portable.zip` | The Windows portable. Extract it and run `Lockverity.exe`. |
| `Lockverity-2.1.0-SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 checksums of the primary release assets. |
| `Lockverity-2.1.0-windows-x64-portable-SHA256SUMS.txt` | SHA-256 checksums of the files inside the portable ZIP. |
| `INSTALLER-MANIFEST.json` | The installer's source identity, embedded payload identity, code-signing status, and Inno Setup compiler fingerprint. |
| `BUILD-MANIFEST.json` | The portable's source identity, build timestamp, Python / PyInstaller / Node / npm versions, and approved brand-asset hashes. |
| `Source code (zip)` / `Source code (tar.gz)` (the `Code → Download ZIP` button) | The Lockverity repository source. Not a packaged application. Use it to develop, audit, or build your own installer / portable. |
| `Lockverity-<version>-windows-x64-portable.zip` (in `dist/windows/`) | The maintainer-side build artefact. Same as the released portable, but generated by `python backend\scripts\build_windows_portable.py`. |

The release assets and the source archive are **not interchangeable**:

- The release assets run on a clean Windows x64 box with no
  Python or Node.js installed.
- The source archive requires Python 3.12, Node.js >= 22.22.0,
  the build tooling, and the v2.1 brand assets to produce a
  working build.
- The release assets are signed by the maintainer only through
  the per-asset SHA-256 in the external checksum file and the
  `INSTALLER-MANIFEST.json` / `BUILD-MANIFEST.json`. There is no
  Authenticode signature, no GPG signature, and no Apple
  notarisation in v2.1.0.
