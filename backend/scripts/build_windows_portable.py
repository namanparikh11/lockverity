"""Cross-platform build script for the Windows portable package.

This script is the canonical v2.1 Part B3A build entry
point. It:

  1. Verifies Windows x64 and the supported Python
     version.

The v2.1.2 hotfix re-points the default portable
filename at ``Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable``
and the build output directory at
``build/packaging/Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip``.
The v2.1.1 portable is preserved on disk and is not
rebuilt by this script.
  2. Verifies the build dependencies (PyInstaller,
     pip-licenses) are installed in the calling
     virtual environment.
  3. Builds/verifies the frontend (runs
     ``scripts/prepare_frontend_dist.py``).
  4. Runs PyInstaller from the committed
     ``pyinstaller/lockverity.spec`` and
     ``pyinstaller/cli.spec``.
  5. Assembles the user-facing portable directory
     layout.
  6. Generates ``THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`` from
     ``pip-licenses``.
  7. Generates ``BUILD-MANIFEST.json``.
  8. Generates ``SHA256SUMS.txt``.
  9. Zips the portable directory into
     ``dist/windows/Lockverity-2.1.2-windows-x64-portable.zip``.
 10. Runs the packaged smoke tests against the
     generated ZIP (unless ``--skip-smoke``).
 11. Emits a structured JSON report on stdout
     (``--json-report``) or a human summary.

The script is dependency-light: it uses the Python
standard library, the existing
``scripts/prepare_frontend_dist.py`` script, and the
documented ``pip-licenses`` CLI. It does not download
binary artefacts from the network. It does not delete
arbitrary ``dist/`` or ``build/`` directories outside
its dedicated packaging work directory
(``build/packaging/``). The committed source tree is
never modified.

The script is intentionally verbose and surfaces a
precise error message at every step. A failed build
exits non-zero with a printed summary of the failing
step and the recommended operator action.

Usage::

    python scripts/build_windows_portable.py
    python scripts/build_windows_portable.py --skip-frontend-build
    python scripts/build_windows_portable.py --skip-smoke
    python scripts/build_windows_portable.py --output-dir build/packaging
