"""End-to-end intake regression test for the DeepSeek-Harness
``archive_symlink_forbidden`` failure.

The manual-QA pass surfaced a production scan failure:
scanning the ``deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`` repository
rejected the entire archive because it contains a single
relative symbolic-link entry under
``.agents/notes/implemented/CLAUDE.md``. The
``build_deepseek_harness_zip`` fixture reproduces the
exact pattern locally so the test does not depend on
a live GitHub mirror.

The fixture mirrors the real DeepSeek Harness
symlink structure exactly:

  - ordinary file: ``deepseek-harness/README.md``
  - relative symlink: ``deepseek-harness/.agents/notes/implemented/CLAUDE.md``
    with target ``../../README.md`` (relative to the
    symlink's parent directory)

Symlink resolution calculation
==============================

The classifier in
:func:`app.utils.archive_validation.ArchiveValidationCollector._classify_symlink_target`
performs the following deterministic, host-filesystem-free
calculation:

  1. **Extract parent dir.** The normalised entry
     path is ``deepseek-harness/.agents/notes/implemented/CLAUDE.md``.
     :func:`posixpath.dirname` returns
     ``deepseek-harness/.agents/notes/implemented``.

  2. **Join parent with literal target.** The
     literal link target string from the ZIP
     entry body is ``../../README.md``.
     :func:`posixpath.join` returns
     ``deepseek-harness/.agents/notes/implemented/../../README.md``.

  3. **Normalise ``..`` segments.**
     :func:`posixpath.normpath` collapses the
     ``..`` segments without touching the host
     filesystem and returns
     ``deepseek-harness/.agents/README.md``.

  4. **Classify.** The resolved path is inside
     the archive namespace (does not start with
     ``..`` or ``/``). The classifier returns
     ``action="skip"`` with
     ``code="archive_symlink_skipped"``. The
     recorded :class:`SkippedSymlink` carries the
     entry path and the normalised target string.

The classifier does **not** check whether the
resolved target actually exists as an archive
entry. The real DeepSeek Harness symlink resolves
to ``deepseek-harness/.agents/README.md`` even
though the project's ``README.md`` lives at the
repo root (``deepseek-harness/README.md``), so the
real symlink is also a "broken" symlink from the
filesystem's point of view. The classifier's
contract is purely about the *literal target
string* and the *archive-namespace safety*; it
does not dereference, does not ``stat``, and does
not require the target to exist.

The ``archive_symlink_target_missing`` code is
raised only for **empty or None** literal target
strings. It is not raised for "target does not
exist as an archive entry" — the classifier never
inspects the archive's other entries.

The test exercises the full ``inspect -> validate ->
extract`` pipeline against the fixture and asserts
the v2.1.3 policy:

  1. The intake succeeds (the archive is not
     rejected).
  2. The ``skipped_symlinks`` collection contains a
     single :class:`SkippedSymlink` with the
     recorded target equal to
     ``deepseek-harness/.agents/README.md`` (the
     deterministic result of the
     ``posixpath.normpath`` calculation above).
  3. The ordinary file (``README.md``) is present
     in the extracted workspace.
  4. The symlink is *not* materialised as a
     filesystem symlink (the validator never
     dereferences it).
  5. The file count and uncompressed size reflect
     only the ordinary file.
