"""v1.1 demo loader tests.

The loader must:

- Build a deterministic SQLite database at the requested
  path.
- Create the schema via Alembic migrations, not via
  ``Base.metadata.create_all``. The resulting database
  must include an ``alembic_version`` table populated with
  the current head revision.
- Be safe to commit (no real secrets, no real personal
  data).
- Refuse to overwrite an existing file unless
  ``--reset-demo-db`` is passed.
- Refuse to write outside the ``backend/var/`` subtree.
- Produce the four documented scan states (completed /
  partial / failed / cancelled) and a screenshot-ready
  completed scan 1 with at least six components.
