"""Regression tests for the removed ``LOCKVERITY_GITHUB_API_URL`` setting.

The configurable GitHub API origin override was removed
in the v2.0.6 public-closure cycle. The bounded HTTP
client allowlist pins the canonical
``https://api.github.com`` host; every URL builder
hardcodes the canonical origin. Operators who set
``LOCKVERITY_GITHUB_API_URL=https://malicious.example/api``
in the environment must NOT see that origin take effect.

The tests in this file prove the contract:

1. ``Settings`` does not expose a ``github_api_url``
   attribute; the obsolete env var is silently ignored.
2. The system info response does not leak any
   ``github_api_url`` field.
3. The canonical GitHub URL is unchanged regardless of
   the obsolete env var.
4. Loading settings with the obsolete env var set does
   not raise.
