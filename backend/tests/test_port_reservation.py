"""Focused tests for the GUI dynamic-port race-free architecture.

The regression the manual-QA pass surfaced was the GUI
refusing to start when another harmless process
(``ReconLoom``) already held ``127.0.0.1:8000``. The
GUI must obtain a free loopback port automatically
and never ask the operator to free a port, kill a
process, or pick a number.

The tests below pin the contract:

  1. ``reserve_loopback_port`` returns a live
     bound-and-listening socket and the kernel-assigned
     port.
  2. The function refuses to bind non-loopback hosts
     (defence against accidental ``0.0.0.0`` exposure).
  3. Two back-to-back reservations do not return the
     same port.
  4. A harmless listener already bound to a known port
     does not prevent the GUI from acquiring another
     loopback port.
  5. The cross-process socket transfer round-trips on
     the current platform (Windows: ``share()`` /
     ``fromshare()``; POSIX: ``fileno()`` /
     ``socket(fileno=...)``).
  6. The launcher's GUI startup path reserves a port
     and never passes the legacy ``--port`` value into
     the supervisor.
  7. The runtime state file records the actual port
     the kernel assigned, not the legacy ``8000``.
  8. A second GUI launch focuses the existing window
     and does not allocate another port.
  9. The ``runner.start`` foreground path is not
     affected: the explicit ``--port`` CLI value is
     honoured and the pre-bound-socket code path is
     not exercised.
