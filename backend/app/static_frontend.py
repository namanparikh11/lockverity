"""Single-port production frontend serving.

This module is the single source of truth for the
"serve the built React UI from the FastAPI host and port"
runtime. The v2.1 Part B1 milestone ships an opt-in feature
flag (``LOCKVERITY_SERVE_FRONTEND``) that, when enabled in a
production environment, mounts the built Vite output
under the existing API host.

Design contract:

  1. The default behaviour is API-only. The flag is
     ``False`` and the production validator refuses the
     flag in development and test environments. The
     existing two-port dev workflow (Vite on 5173, FastAPI
     on 8000) is unchanged.

  2. The configured dist path is resolved deterministically
     against the repository root, not the operator's
     current working directory. An absolute override is
     accepted.

  3. The path is validated at startup time. A missing
     directory or a missing ``index.html`` is a fatal
     startup error so a stale build is never served
     silently.

  4. The path is verified to resolve inside the repository
     root or to be a deliberate absolute override. Path
     traversal segments are rejected by the settings
     validator; the request handlers also defensively
     verify the resolved path stays inside the dist root.

  5. The serving is read-only. The backend never executes
     npm, never runs the Vite build, and never writes to
     the dist directory. Build preparation is a separate
     ``scripts/prepare_frontend_dist.py`` step.

  6. The serving cannot expose workspace files. The
     ``workspace_root`` setting is unrelated to the
     frontend dist; the static-file root is the configured
     dist directory only.
