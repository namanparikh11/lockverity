"""Start and stop helpers for the ``lockverity`` CLI.

The :class:`Runner` class is the runtime workhorse for
the ``start`` and ``stop`` commands. The class is
intentionally small: it wraps the platform-portable
operations the CLI needs to do, and leaves the
operator-facing UX (argparse, formatting) to the
:mod:`app.cli.commands` modules.

Start flow
==========

1. Acquire the cross-platform start lock so two
   simultaneous ``lockverity start`` commands cannot
   both launch servers. The lock is held for the
   entire lifetime of the child process and is
   released in the ``finally`` block.
2. Resolve the runtime home (caller has done this).
3. Validate the frontend dist (caller has done this
   via the Part B1 settings validator).
4. Validate the port is free (caller has done this).
5. Generate a non-secret instance UUID and pass it
   to the private child serve entry point as
   ``--instance-id <UUID>``. The UUID is the strong
   identity fingerprint the live-process check
   verifies at ``stop`` / ``status`` time.
6. Run ``alembic upgrade head`` in a clean
   subprocess. The subprocess is constructed with an
   explicit argument list (no ``shell=True``); the
   database URL is passed through the documented
   ``LOCKVERITY_DATABASE_URL`` environment variable
   so the application's ``alembic/env.py`` does not
   override it.
7. Launch ``python -m uvicorn app.main:app`` as a
   background subprocess with the
   ``--instance-id <UUID>`` argument. The child
   inherits the Part B1 production posture.
8. Wait for the health endpoint to report ready.
9. Write the state file atomically. The state file
   contains the PID, creation time, instance UUID,
   and the documented non-secret schema.
10. Return a structured :class:`StartResult`.

Stop flow
=========

1. Read the state file.
2. Verify the recorded process identity via
   :func:`app.cli.process.verify_identity`. The
   check requires the live process to match the
   recorded PID + creation time + instance UUID +
   module. A PID that has been recycled for an
   unrelated process never matches.
3. Send a graceful termination signal via
   :func:`app.cli.process.terminate_process`.
4. Wait for the process to exit (bounded).
5. Force-kill only on explicit ``--force`` and only
   after the grace period has elapsed. The
   force-kill uses :func:`app.cli.process.force_terminate_process`
   which maps to ``SIGKILL`` on POSIX and
   ``TerminateProcess`` on Windows.
6. Clear the state file.
7. Return a structured :class:`StopResult`.

The runner never calls ``shell=True``. Every subprocess
is constructed with an explicit argument list so the
caller can audit the exact command the CLI issues.

         translator so a Windows
         ``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` from an external
         test harness (or a ``START /B`` shell)
         unwinds the surrounding
         ``with start_lock.acquire(home):`` block
         and the documented KeyboardInterrupt exit
         code propagates to the operator.
      2. Launches the ``app.cli._serve`` child via
         :class:`subprocess.Popen` (not detached)
         so the child shares the supervisor's
         console; ``Ctrl+C`` in the console goes
         to both the supervisor and the child.
      3. Waits for the documented health readiness
         before publishing the runtime state. The
         state file records the *child* identity
         (PID, creation time, instance UUID,

         ``status`` / ``status --json`` /
         ``open --print-url`` / ``logs`` /
         ``stop`` against the same instance.
      4. Waits for the child to exit. The wait
         observes three documented exit paths:
         (a) the operator presses Ctrl+C (or
         ``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` is delivered to the
         supervisor's process group);
         (b) the operator runs ``lockverity stop``
         from a second terminal; the
         ``runner.stop`` function reads the state
         file, verifies the live-process identity,
         and signals the child PID; the supervisor
         observes the child exit and unwinds
         normally;
         (c) the child exits unexpectedly (crash,
         external kill). The supervisor cleans up
         the state file (instance-scoped) and the
         surrounding ``with`` block releases the
         start lock.
      5. Always cleans up the state file
         instance-scoped before returning, so no
         false-running state remains on disk.

    A :class:`KeyboardInterrupt` raised during
    the wait is caught and re-raised only after
    the child has been terminated, the state has
    been removed, and the supervisor's log line
    has been written. The caller (``start()``) does
    not catch the exception; it propagates to the
