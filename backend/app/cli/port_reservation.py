"""Race-free loopback port reservation for the GUI launcher.

The Lockverity desktop application (``Lockverity.exe``)
must own a loopback backend port. The legacy behaviour
hard-coded a fixed port (``8000``); a hostile or
benign-wrong application already bound to that port made
the GUI refuse to start. The new behaviour is to ask the
operating system to assign an unused loopback port from
the ``IANA ephemeral`` range and use that exact port
for the owned backend.

The class is intentionally narrow: it returns a
already-bound ``socket.socket`` together with the
port the OS assigned. The caller is responsible for
either:

  - keeping the socket alive for the lifetime of the
    child server (the ``DesktopBackendSupervisor``
    does this on POSIX), or

  - transferring the bound socket into the child
    process via :func:`share_socket_to_subprocess` /
    :func:`reconstruct_shared_socket` (the
    cross-process Windows path).

Critical race-safety contract
=============================

This module NEVER implements the
``probe-free-port → close-probe-socket → later-bind``
pattern. Every port returned by :func:`reserve_loopback_port`
is owned by a live :class:`socket.socket` the OS will not
hand to another process while the socket stays open. The
caller either keeps the socket alive or transfers it to
the child; nothing else.

A normal Windows desktop GUI must never ask the user to
free a port, choose a port, kill a process, or wait for
a collision to time out. This module is the single
chokepoint that delivers on that contract.

#
# The desktop launcher owns the reserved socket in the
# ``Lockverity.exe`` process. The Uvicorn child server
# runs in a child process launched via
# :mod:`subprocess`. The socket must be transferred to
# the child so the same kernel binding serves the
# child; passing the port number and rebinding in the
# child would briefly release the port and could be
# stolen by another process. The two transfer
# mechanisms are:
#
#   - **POSIX**: ``socket.fileno()`` plus the
#     ``subprocess`` ``pass_fds`` argument. The child
#     reconstructs the socket with
#     :func:`socket.socket` and the inherited fd.
#
#   - **Windows**: ``socket.share()`` returns a portable
#     shareable handle blob. The child reconstructs
#     the socket with :func:`socket.fromshare`.
