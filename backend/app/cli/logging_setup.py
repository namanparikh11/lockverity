"""Bounded rotating runtime log for the ``lockverity`` CLI.

The ``start`` command uses this module to wire a
:class:`logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` against the
``logs/lockverity.log`` file under the runtime home. The
handler is bounded: every rotated file is at most
``max_bytes`` (10 MiB by default) and at most
``backup_count`` (5 by default) generations are kept. The
total disk footprint is therefore at most
``max_bytes * (backup_count + 1)`` bytes.

The setup function is idempotent: re-invoking it with
the same ``log_path`` returns the existing handler so
``start`` can call it from both the foreground and
background code paths without double-attaching.

The handler never writes secrets: the log records
level, time, logger name, and message. The CLI does
not configure a ``logging.Filter`` for the LogRecord
``args`` or ``msg`` because the application log
messages never embed a token or password; the
boundary is enforced by the *application* code
that emits the log records, not by this handler.
