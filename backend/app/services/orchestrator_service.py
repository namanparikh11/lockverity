"""Scan orchestrator.

The :class:`ScanOrchestrator` drives a :class:`ScanRun` through
its stages. It honours cancellation between stages, records a
:func:`ProviderObservation` for every stage, and ensures that
unsupported stages are recorded as ``not_requested`` rather than
silently completed.

The orchestrator does not run any provider logic. The stages
that need provider work are *observed* but skipped; they are
present so the scan lifecycle is observable end to end.
