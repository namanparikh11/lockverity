"""Archive-entry validation contract.

Lockverity v0.1 does **not** extract archives. It validates the entries
inside a zip / tar stream up front so a malicious upload cannot reach
the filesystem layer. The validation is intentionally aggressive: the
default behavior is to reject anything that does not pass every check.

Validation performed on each archive entry:

1. Path traversal (``../``, ``..\\``)
2. Absolute POSIX paths (``/etc/passwd``)
3. Windows drive-letter paths (``C:\\evil``)
4. UNC paths (``\\\\server\\share``)
5. Symbolic-link and hard-link entries when the format exposes the
   metadata
6. Duplicate normalized entries (zip slip variants that bypass the path
   check via encodings)
7. Excessive directory depth
8. Oversized individual entries
9. Excessive cumulative uncompressed size
10. Suspicious compression ratios (zip bomb heuristic)
11. Excessive file count

v2.1.3 symlink-handling policy
==============================

The historical policy refused any archive containing a
symbolic-link or hard-link entry. The policy was
over-conservative for repository-analysis archives: many
legitimate open-source repositories (``linux``, the
``deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`` snapshot, etc.)
contain symbolic links and the entire archive was
rejected before any analysis.

The new policy is split:

  * **Hard-fail** on a symbolic link whose *normalised
    target* resolves outside the archive root, on an
    absolute POSIX target, on a Windows drive target,
    on a UNC target, on a malformed target, and on
    any target that would cause the validator to
    dereference the host filesystem. Hardlinks remain
    a hard fail (the policy is unchanged for hardlinks
    because the security boundary is binary, not
    semantic).

  * **Skip + record** every other symbolic link. The
    validator records the entry under the new
    ``archive_symlink_skipped`` warning code with the
    safe archive-relative target, never follows the
    link, and never creates a filesystem symlink. The
    rest of the archive continues through the normal
    validation flow. The skipped entries are reported
    in the intake result so the scan evidence layer
    can mark the analysis as ``partial`` rather than
    ``failed`` when the omission materially affects
    coverage.

  * **Symlink cycles and chains** are bounded by the
    skip policy: the validator never resolves a chain
    because it never follows the first link. The
    chain is recorded by the safe relative target
    only.

The ``archive_symlink_target_missing`` code is raised
*only* when the literal target string is empty or
None. It is **not** raised for "target does not exist
as an archive entry" — that case is recorded as
``archive_symlink_skipped`` because the resolved path
is inside the archive namespace. The classifier
never inspects the archive's other entries, never
dereferences the host filesystem, and never requires
the target to exist as a real entry in the archive.

        Symlink-target contract
        ======================

        The classifier's contract is purely about
        the *literal target string* and the
        *archive-namespace safety*. The classifier:

          - **Never** inspects the archive's other
            entries. ``archive_symlink_target_missing``
            is **not** raised for "target does not
            exist as an archive entry" — that case
            is recorded as ``archive_symlink_skipped``
            because the resolved path is inside the
            archive namespace.

          - **Never** dereferences the host filesystem
            or calls ``os.path.realpath``. The
            resolution is purely a
            :func:`posixpath.normpath` calculation
            over the entry's parent + the literal
            target.

          - **Never** records the literal target
            string. The recorded value is the
            :func:`posixpath.normpath` result of
            ``posixpath.join(parent, literal_target)``.

        The deepseek-harness regression fixture
        mirrors the real repository exactly: the
        ``README.md`` lives at the repo root, the
        symlink entry lives at
        ``deepseek-harness/.agents/notes/implemented/CLAUDE.md``,
        and the literal target is ``../../README.md``.
        The classifier normalises this to
        ``deepseek-harness/.agents/README.md`` and
        records it as ``archive_symlink_skipped`` —
        the same code as for any other safe relative
        symlink. The classifier does not flag the
        fact that the real DeepSeek Harness symlink
        is technically "broken" (its target is not
        an existing entry in the archive); the

        *target existence*.
